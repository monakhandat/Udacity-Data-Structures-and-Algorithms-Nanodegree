## Project 2- Show Me the Data Structures  
### Problem 4- Blockchain Implementation    
  
- In this problem, I implemented intersection first by taking out common elements
- Used the intersection elements for union by adding two lists and removing intersection elements

Time Complexity-  
- For Intersection- O(n1*n2)
- For Union- O(# of intersections)

Space Complexity-  
- O(number of elements in both list)
