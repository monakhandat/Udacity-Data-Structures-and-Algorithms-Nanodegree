## Project 3- Problems vs Algorithms
### Problem 1- Square root of integer

- Used binary search method with starting number= 1 and end number as the given number
- Starting with square of average of start number and end number is compared with given number
- start number or end number is changed by 1 depending on the square of middle number

Time complexity-

- O(log n)

Space complexity-
- O(1)
