## Project 3- Problems vs Algorithms
### Problem 2- Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
  
   
   
- An index from where the array is not sorted is found using, divide_array method
- Two sorted arrays are created using returned index from divide_array method
- Individual binary search is performed on each of the sorted arrays
- Index of the number from original list is found and returned; otherwise -1 is returned
  
Time complexity-  
- 0(log n)
    
Space complexity-  
- O(n)
