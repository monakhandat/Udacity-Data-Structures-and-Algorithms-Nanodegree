## Project 3- Problems vs Algorithms
### Problem 3- Rearrange Array Elements
  
   
  
- Sorted the given list in descending order
- Formed two numbers each with even and odd indices respectively from the sorted list
- Used mergesort as its time complexity is O(n*log n) as required in the problem statement
  
Time complexity-  
- O(nlogn) for sorting; O(n) in forming the numbers
- Overall- O(nlogn)
  
Space complexity-  
- O(n) where n is the elements in the list
