### Problem 6- Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
  
  
- In this problem, minimum and maximum numbers are to be returned from unsorted array in a single traversal
- Stored min and max numbers and swapped with current element if current element is smaller than minimum number or if the current element is more than maximum number
- End of the traversal, max and min numbers are stored in the initial variables
  
  
Time complexity- O(n) as only one for loop is used. 
  
Space complexity- O(n) as all the elements are stored
